DAY-1
I set up the system that is required for studying data science.
I got stuck in how the repositories and files work.
Basics of Python felt very easy.
I made few syntax mistakes like giving space instead of _ in between veriable name and not ending the statement with bracket while printing.
I promise "I'll show up tomorrow".

DAY-2
I have clearly understood the variables in Python and their type conversion.  
in type conversion, i was applying brackets on the datatype name like (int) but i have to do it like int().  
String + Integer gives error.
I want to improve my speed and try to finish Two-Day checklist in One-Day.
